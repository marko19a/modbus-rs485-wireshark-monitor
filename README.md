# Introduction
This Python script allows you to monitor Modbus RTU messages with Wireshark. \
It connects to a serial port where the Modbus USB adapter (RS485) is attached and creates a file pipe (FIFO). \
All captured data is packaged into pcap packets that can be received via this pipe by Wireshark to display the Modbus packets.

# Changes / Added Features
Project is originally cloned from https://github.com/Pinoccio/tool-serial-pcap

- Use a user DLT (data link type) and remove non-working pcap encapsulation
- Remove blocking code that prevents receiving data from the USB Modbus adapter
- Keep the serial port always open instead of opening/closing on each cycle (avoids losing data)
- Add Modbus RTU packet parser
- Output packets on the command line (while forwarding to Wireshark via the pipe /tmp/wireshark)

 Note: Code was reworked with assistance from copilot AI and may not work in all situations.

# Installation and Start
There are two ways: directly in your system or indirectly in a venv via serial-pcap.sh

**Manually**
~~~sh
# Install python3 on your system
apt install python3

# Install dependency on your system
pip install pyserial

# Start script
/serial-pcap.py -b 19200 --fifo /tmp/wireshark /dev/ttyUSB0
~~~

**Indirectly via venv**
The virtual environment directory is created in ./.venv.
~~~sh
# Start script (via venv)
./serial-pcap.sh
~~~

## Prepare Wireshark
Wireshark allows reading data from pipes and handles the data the same way as it loads a pcap file.
The script first creates a pcap header, and all subsequent request and response packets are packed into their own pcap records.

To ensure Wireshark receives the required pcap header, Wireshark must be configured and started **BEFORE** starting the ```serial-pcap.py``` script.

- Start serial-pcap.py
- Start Wireshark
- Configure Wireshark to process the user DLT (used by script in the pcap header) as Modbus RTU packets:
  - Go to ```Edit->Preferences->Protocol->DLT_USER```
  - Edit *Encapsulations Table*
  - Add a new entry (if not already), select ```DLT=147``` for DLT, and set _Payload protocol_ to ```mbrtu```
  - Press OK and close Preferences
- Go to ```Capture->Options->Manage Interfaces->Pipes```, add the pipe ```/tmp/wireshark``` and press OK
- **Select the pipe** (in current dialog, which is now added to the list)
- Apply the display filter "modbus"
- press "Start"

If the pipe was already created before (manually via mkfifo /tmp/wireshark or by a previous call to serial-pcap),
Wireshark will start monitoring.

Unfortunately, Wireshark only remembers the Encapsulations Table entries, but not the pipe.
The pipe must be configured each time after starting Wireshark.

## Windows WSL2 / Linux
When running on Windows WSL2, use **"WSL USB Manager"** to pass the USB RS485 dongle to WSL.
- Add the WSL2 user to the 'dialout' group to allow access to /dev/ttyX....
  `usermod -aG dialout your-user-name`
- Install Wireshark within WSL2 to access the /tmp/wireshark (pipe).
  `apt install wireshark`
- Add the user to 'wireshark' group
    `usermod -aG wireshark your-user-name`
